# Red Team Attack Lab
This project documents a personal red team lab designed to explore
realistic attack scenarios against a Linux server.

The goal is to understand how attackers discover, exploit, and
chain vulnerabilities, and how these issues can be mitigated.

## Lab Overview
- Attacker: Kali Linux
- Victim: Ubuntu Server
- Network: Isolated internal network

## Scope
- Network reconnaissance
- Weak authentication exploitation
- Web application vulnerabilities
- Privilege escalation
- Mitigation and hardening

## Disclaimer
This project is for educational purposes only.
All attacks are performed in an isolated lab environment.
